                                        INTRODUCTION:  

=======================================================================================================

	Ah, the interwebzâ€¦ what was once a paragon of creativity and free speech has rapidly 
	declined into a festering cess-pool of depravity and skidiocracy -- over the course
	of the last few decades, we have witnessed the internet morph into a filthy pit of 
	degeneracy and despair.

	As a group of former blackhats, we have decided to do something about this. Rather
	than letting these twisted mentally-deficient troglodytes get away with such
	sickening activities. Scammers, Pedos, Script Kiddies, Fraudsters, Terrorists, 
	Sex Offenders, or any others destined to burn in hell... this is a message to you:

	You are not safe online. You will never be safe again, not online nor in person. We
	advise that you lock your doors when you go to sleep. We consider ourselves to be
	judges of criminal activities, and if you are found guilty of a severe enough crime,
	then one of our associates might just show up at your door to pass judgement IRL.

	It is our role to expunge you both from the internet and from your local area. Any
	groups that we come across will be systematically dismantled, both online and also
	in person. 

	It is our primary role to observe the hacking scbee, and whenever any group of skids
	becomes too prominent, it results in us making a decision that they need to be taken
	back to reality, generally as a result of a quick slap in the face.

	In addition to hacking, doxing, and demoralizing the various targets we've chosen
	within this e-zine, we will also be covering some guides on different forms of 
	pwnage that you will see being carried out by us during future e-zines. Hopefully
	this can also act as inspiration for you (the readers) to assist when it comes to
	throwing scum into the trash.

	Finally, this e-zine will end with a "hit list" - a list of names or websites for
	us to target within the next issue of the e-zine. Having a list helps hold us 
	responsible when it pertains to taking out those who we have decided to target.
	If you happen to see your name on one of these lists, then we suggest that you
	pack your bags and run for the hills. You'll know what you've done, and if you
	have got any sense then you should run away whilst you still have the chance to
	do so.

	With that being said -- strap in, enjoy the read, and prepare to witness levels
	of pwnage that are unfathomable for mere mortals to even begin to comprehend.

	  Yours maliciously, 
	          - v4nQu1sH3d.



=======================================================================================================
			         	[X] 0x02: [X]  

                                      CONTACT + UPDATES:

=======================================================================================================

	Got any recommendations as to which worthless miscreants should be added to our hit list?
	We are open for recommendations!

	Just remember; we are not your personal army. If you give us a potential target, then 
	there needs to be a good reason as to why that person, website, or group has been chosen
	as a potential target. If your reasoning for asking us to target them happens to be that
	you simply just don't like them, then that's an ideal way for you to make yourself one
	of our targets... so with that in mind, please be careful before you start recommending
	targets to us, and please make sure that you have a decent reason as to why this target
	was selected. 

	Anyhow, to contact us, simply send an email to the address below:
	- 0xM@null.net

	To allow our automated systems to sort through the emails, include one of the four
	following strings somewhere in the email subject/title:

	- 1xD224jqU7 	[FOR TARGET RECOMMENDATIONS]
	- 3xJuwlO93x 	[FOR MEMBERSHIP APPLICATIONS]
	- 1x0oIcN32u 	[FOR GENERAL QUERIES]
	- 7XTTg846Ym 	[FOR ANYTHING ELSE]

	If your email doesn't contain any of the four strings listed above somewhere within
	the email subject, then it will be ignored. We have set this up via automation in
	order to be able to efficiently categorize our emails and to ensure that we don't
	have to be constantly dealing with spam emails from skiddies who got butthurt that
	we pwned them. If the email that you send doesn't contain any of these strings 
	within the subject title, then we won't be able to receive it as our filters will
	end up blocking it.

	Below you can find a copy of our PGP key. This is to confirm that we are exactly
	who we claim to be. We are operating under the assumption that others will 
	pretend to be us for the two following reasons:

	1) Attention-whoring skidiots have got to get their attention somewhere.
	2) Some of the more "calculated" groups who we target will attempt to run
	   disinformation campaigns by making releases under our name in order to
	   cause doubt and confusion.

	As such, please keep in mind that any future releases that are *NOT* signed
        with our PGP key are not releases from us, and are from other people instead.

	If the key does happen to be signed, yet you have doubts about authorship, then
	just remember that if it's actually us, we can display the corresponding private
	key and will be happy to do so in order to verify our identity.

	Our valid PGP key can be found below:
